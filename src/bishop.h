/*
We want to perfectly hash the bishop attack based off origin square
and relevant occupancy bits (pieces occupying relevant diagonals)

N - the number of k-bit spaced positions that may be set for 1
(for bishops N <= 8, k = 9 for NoEa diagonals, k = 7 for NoWe diagonals)
arrBishopAttacks: bishop_square -> (table: occ -> attack bitmap)

We mask relevant occupancy squares relative to a bishop placement with
a magic number to get the N relavant bits in the bishops way
We can use this number to hash into the attacks table to get an attack bitboard
