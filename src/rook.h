/*
We want to perfectly hash the Rook attack based off origin square
and relevant occupancy bits (pieces occupying relevant diagonals)

N - the number of k-bit spaced positions that may be set for 1
(for rooks N = k = 8)
arrRookAttacks: rook_square -> (table: occ -> attack bitmap)

We mask relevant occupancy squares, relative to a rook placement, with
a magic number to get the N relavant bits in the rooks way
We can use this number to hash into the attacks table to get an attack bitboard
